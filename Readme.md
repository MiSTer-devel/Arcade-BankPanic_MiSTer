# BankPanic for MiSTerFPGA

## General description
This is the port of Bank Panic for MiSTerFPGA by Pierco (Pierre Cornier). I tried to reproduce the PCB as much as possible so it should be very close to the original hardware.

I would like to give special thanks to Mark Haysman from RetroClinic for sharing the equations of the PAL 315-5075, and to David Shadoff, Alan Steremberg & Chockichoc for their support and friendship!
